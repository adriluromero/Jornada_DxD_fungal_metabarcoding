#Protocol for processing Metabarcoding of soil
#Section 1
#File name: 1_Initial_quality_reports
#Step: Generate quality reports of raw paired-end sequences.

#In this script, you will: 
# 1. Unzip the file folder received from the sequencing facility. 
# 2. Move the extracted '.fastq.gz' files to a 'files' directory.
# 3. Generate fastqc reports on the quality of the '.fastq.gz' files.
# 4. Use multiqc to compile the data from all individual fastqc reports into one report. 

#Memory requirements for bash script: 
#--cpus-per-task=20 ##The number of threads the code will use
#--mem-per-cpu=10G  ## Real memory(MB) per CPU required by the job.


#1. Unzip the file folder received from the sequencing facility. 

#Extract the sequencing files from the 'archive-GSF3045.tar' file

tar -xvf /fs1/project/egcc/archive-GSF3045.tar

#2. Move the extracted '.fastq.gz' files to a '.fastq.gz' directory.

mv /fs1/project/egcc/*.fastq.gz /fs1/project/egcc/fastq.gz

#These files were already demultiplexed by the sequencing facility so we can skip this step. 

#Note. The files 'Undetermined_S0_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz' and 'Undetermined_S0_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz'will be excluded from subsequent processing.

#3. Generate fastqc reports on the quality of the '.fastq.gz' files.

#Activate the 'qc' conda environment to use fastqc version 0.11.9 and multiqc version 1.13

echo "Load the qc environment."
module load conda
conda activate /fs1/project/egcc/conda_env/qc

#Generate fastqc reports for all files with a '.fastq.gz' extension.
fastqc /fs1/project/egcc/fastq.gz/*.fastq.gz

echo "Make a directory where these files will go."
mkdir /fs1/project/egcc/QC

#Since these reports are pre-trimming, create a 'pre-trim' directory for the reports.
mkdir /fs1/project/egcc/QC/pre-trim

echo "Move the individual fastqc reports to the pre-trim directory."
mv /fs1/project/egcc/fastq.gz/*fastqc* /fs1/project/egcc/QC/pre-trim

#4. Use multiqc to compile the data from all individual fastqc reports into one report.

#A single multiqc report makes it easier to view information on all of your files. For example, cheking for adapter content across files. 

echo "Make a directory where the files will go."
mkdir /fs1/project/egcc/QC/pre-trim/multiqc

echo "Run multiqc"
multiqc /fs1/project/egcc/QC/pre-trim -o /fs1/project/egcc/QC/pre-trim/multiqc
#Set the -o flag to the directory where you'd like to save the multiqc report.
