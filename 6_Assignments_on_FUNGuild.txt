#Step: Use command line to make functional assignments using FUNGuild.


#If this is your first time using FUNGuild refer to https://github.com/UMNFuN/FUNGuild to get started. 
#The README.md file has a section on "Running the script locally from the command line" which explains what to do. 

# 1. Run FUNGuild on command line using the formatted ASV table. 

Open command Prompt.

Use the command cd to set the directory to where the 'guild.py' script is saved.

Now, run FUNGuild on command line. The command to use is found after the ">":

C:\Users\ecoli\Documents\FUNGuild\Metabarcoding>python guilds.py -otu FUNGuildDxD.txt -db fungi -m -u

#Below is an example of what you will see after running this command. 

##EXAMPLE:

#FunGuild v1.1 Beta
#Connecting with FUNGuild database ...

#Reading in the OTU table: 'FUNGuildDxD.txt'

#Searching the FUNGuild database...
#10%
#20%
#30%
#40%
#50%
#60%
#70%
#80%
#90%
#100%

#Found 828 matching taxonomy records in the database.
#Dereplicating and sorting the result...
#FunGuild tried to assign function to 705 OTUs in 'FUNGuildDxD.txt'.
#FUNGuild made assignments on 492 OTUs.
#Result saved to 'FUNGuildDxD.guilds.txt'

#Additional output:
#FUNGuild made assignments on 492 OTUs, these have been saved to FUNGuildDxD.guilds_matched.txt.
#213 OTUs were unassigned, these are saved to FUNGuildDxD.guilds_unmatched.txt.

#Total calculating time: 9.54 seconds.

#####Save the 'FUNGuildDxD.guilds.txt' file as .csv to use in step 7.
